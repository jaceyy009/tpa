## Biography

Xyvar Thorne was born March 9, 1945, in Canchworth, BF, a city known for high poverty and political unrest. His father, Aldric Thorne, was a military officer in the Ofcairnlu army; his mother, Celia Thorne, taught at Canchworth Elementary School.

As a child, Xyvar was quiet, intelligent, and preferred books to social interaction. He excelled academically, with particular interest in psychology, criminology, and philosophy. Peers and teachers often described him as cold and distant.

After completing primary school, he gained admission to the extremely selective University of Ofcairnlu Champions (only 457 students as of 2000). There he studied psychology and criminology, earning his doctorate at age 26. His academic work focused on the darker aspects of human nature—crime, punishment, and justice. He came to believe that society’s traditional approach to law and order was weak and misguided, and began seeking a more “efficient” solution.

In 1971, the Ofcairnlu government recruited him as a counterintelligence adviser. Over the next decade he rose to a significant position, advising on national security and overseeing covert operations against internal threats. During this time his extreme beliefs solidified: true justice, he concluded, required absolute control and the elimination of those deemed unworthy—later termed “mental purification.”

By the mid-1970s he began secretly gathering followers, many of them disillusioned ex-government agents. On May 17, 1978, he officially founded **The Path of Ascendancy (TPA)**—a secretive organization combining militant ideology, psychological manipulation, and brutal enforcement.

As TPA grew, it forged clandestine alliances with factions in intelligence, law enforcement, and the military. By the late 1980s its followers were embedded throughout the government, carrying out covert “purges” of individuals and groups labeled criminal—including children seen as irredeemably tainted.

On April 2, 1999, Xyvar Thorne disappeared without trace. Some believe he was eliminated by government factions fearing his growing power; others think he orchestrated his own vanishing to continue his work from the shadows. After his disappearance, TPA continued to operate and expand under his lieutenants, deepening its influence over the state while remaining hidden from the public.
